# Rock Varnish, Black Rock crust, Desert varnish

The origin of rock varnish has remained a mystery since Alexander Von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland first encountered it near the Orinoco River. Their expedition and observation of Black rock crust between Santa Barabra and 
Black rock crust, Rock varnish, or Desert varnish is an amorphous patina found on substrates that are resistant to weathering. More specifically it is an assortment of clay, birnessite, hematite, and quartz in laminae with
botryoidal texture (Lingappa et al. 2021, Ren et al. 2019). It can be found on various rock types
in equatorial desert environments to polar arctic regions, and may even form as nodules along the
abyssal plain. It was first described by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonaplad in personal
narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America 1799-1804; a brownish black crust on
rocks between the missions of Carichana and Santa Barbara. Afterwards, it was described by Charles Darwin and
Swedish chemist Jöns Berezelius in The voyage of the beagle in 1839. Berzelius identified its
composition as iron and manganese oxides; Darwin predicted periodical floods as a means for its
origin. However, the mechanism and origin continues to be debated among researchers. I would
like to continue this debate.

Previous studies on rock varnish from south east Death Valley (DVNP) concluded the
laminae varies in composition. The red layers’ concentration in iron and manganese oxides differ
from the darker layers- the bottom red layer and top layer are enriched with carbon and nitrogen
(Perry et al. 2005). Nonetheless, the origin of these organic elements remain unsolved. There are
many reports that describe the characteristics of rock varnish found throughout DVNP.
On the other hand, open access reports on rock varnish from Joshua Tree national park
(JTNP) and Anza Borrego desert state park (ADSP) are limited. Soils in JTNP contain various
microbes, including green algae that live in hypersaline environments (Flechtner et al. 2013).
The majority of JTNP rocks with varnish coatings are Jurassic to Quaternary aged granites and
sediments (Boyd 2019, NPS 2018). There are many implications for a relationship between rock
varnish and paleoclimatic events. The microbes and composition of the soils found near rock
varnish sites adjacent to the Red Sea could explain the organics in varnish lamina (Wieler et al.
2021). Rock varnish has received substantial interest in the past for its puzzling geochemical
properties and mechanism of formation.
Many researchers have set out to use rock varnish as a potential paleoclimate proxy or
dating technique or even as an identification of paleoclimates on Mars (Dorn 2009, Harmon et
al. 2021, Lingappa et al. 2021, Perry et al. 2005, Wieler et al. 2021, Yeager 2009). Although, the
origin of the organics on the lamina has been sustainably debated. Nonetheless, petroglyphs
carved out of rock varnish surfaces by native civilizations can be found throughout the globe.
